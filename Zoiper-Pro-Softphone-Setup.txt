"Connectivity" Submenu: 

Enable "PUSH proxy" | Enable "Run in background" | "Push transport = TLS".


"Advanced" Submenu:

"TLS Ciphers = Use only strong ciphers" | Enable "Start with android".


In account settings:

Fill in "voicemail extension"

"Audio codec settings = Enable uLaw / GSM / g729"

"Encryption settings = Enable SRTP"

"Network settings => Transport type = Enable TLS"

"Features => Subscribe for MWI = Before registration"


Enable "unrestricted data" AND "Do not disturb access" in android "Apps => Special apps access".


Make it so any "battery saver" mode CANNOT stop the app from running, and make sure encryption is enabled on the VOIP SIP account at the service provider.


Do NOT enable bluetooth permission in the app (AKA "detect nearby devices" android app permission), otherwise you may get a "normal local hang up" message, canceling outbound calls.


Review all the app's permissions in it's settings section.
